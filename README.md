# Nanocode: A Deterministic Symbolic Program Synthesis Substrate

Nanocode is a research-grade computational substrate built around a fully
deterministic term-rewriting interpreter. It provides a uniform symbolic
framework for:

- program synthesis
- structure-preserving mutation and recombination
- meta-level program representation
- deterministic agent rollouts
- audit-ready trace generation

This repository contains:
- the public whitepaper
- architecture overview
- conceptual documentation
- example workflows
- demo videos and testing walkthroughs

The **source code is not included**. The implementation remains private during
partner evaluation and technical review.

## Overview

Nanocode explores an alternative to stochastic machine learning systems by
building a deterministic symbolic runtime that:

- represents all programs as canonical symbolic terms  
- executes via explicit rewrite rules  
- enforces structure through validation guards  
- enables deterministic program evolution  
- supports a meta-representation layer for introspection  
- emits fully traceable JSON/JSONL execution logs  

The goal is to provide a transparent, auditable substrate for
interpretable computation, evolvable logic systems, and deterministic agents.

## Documentation

- **Whitepaper (Public Edition)** – `WHITEPAPER.md`  
- **Architecture Overview** – `docs/architecture.md`  
- **Testing Walkthrough Video** – see `/demo/`  
- **Concept Overview** – `docs/concepts.md`

## Purpose

Nanocode is released publicly at the conceptual level to:

1. invite discussion  
2. support academic interest  
3. provide transparency into the research direction  
4. establish authorship and vision  

The implementation remains private while partnerships, validation, and
commercial considerations are underway.
